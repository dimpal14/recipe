# Demo

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.2.

## Description

This is a Recipes Angular application that includes a recipe service to search, retrieve, and display recipes. The application uses Angular's HttpClientModule for making HTTP requests and Angular Router for navigation.

## Development server

```bash
ng serve
```
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

ng generate component component-name
```
